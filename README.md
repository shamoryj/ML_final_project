# ML G11 Final Project Code

This code is all written in jupyter notebooks and requires the following python packages to run:
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

Please run preprocess_data.ipynb first, which will preprocess the data found in the folder "weather_data" and produce the file "all_weather_data.csv".

The data is included in the github and originally came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data?select=city_attributes.csv).
